This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi).

It is an assignment for [yield.fi](yield.fi). The app uses wagmi.sh and provides a simple UI to connect a metamask wallet & checkout different chains.

The UI also contains some elements inspired from yield.fi's website such as overall colors, hover effects on drawer items & dialog boxes for connect & switching chains, etc.

### running
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
> The app needs metamask installed in the browser.

### notes
Great assignment to get started on web3 connectors & wallets. [wagmi.sh](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started) is really spec'd out & easy to follow.
